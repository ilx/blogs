MDB with Spring on Websphere (8.5)
==================================

== Introduction ==

Usually, I would just fire up DefaultMessageListenerContainer connect it to the taskexecutor baked by WorkManager and stopped worrying.
This time I decided to create MDB that will utilize Spring framework and run on WebSphere 8. 
Development environment: eclipse, maven, websphere 8.5, spring 3.2.1.


Let's see how that went.


- I created maven parent project:  mdb-parent
-- add following property to the parent pom:
[source,xml]
------------
  <properties>
  	<project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
  </properties>
------------

-- under parent project I create 2 submodules: 
--- mdb-web
---- create empty web.xml so that m2e configures project nature


--- mdb-ear
---- create empty application.xml so that m2e configures project nature
