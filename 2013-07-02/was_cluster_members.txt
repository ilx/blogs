import sys

"""
List application servers that belong to a particular cluster
Cluster name is passed as a parameter to the script
"""
cluster_name=sys.argv[0]

# Get configID of the cluster
cluster_conf_id = AdminConfig.getid("/ServerCluster:"+cluster_name )
if not cluster_conf_id:
    raise "Cluster %s does not exist!" % cluster_name

# Get confids of the cluster members
member_conf_ids = AdminConfig.showAttribute(cluster_conf_id, "members")
# AdminConfig returns the list in [], get rid of the brackets
member_conf_ids = member_conf_ids[1:-1]
print "Cluster %s has following members:" % cluster_name  
# split by space
for member_conf_id in member_conf_ids.split():
    # Obtain server name and node name
    member_name=AdminConfig.showAttribute(member_conf_id, "memberName")
    node_name=AdminConfig.showAttribute(member_conf_id, "nodeName")
    print node_name+"/"+member_name
