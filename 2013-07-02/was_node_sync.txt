"""
Sync configuration changes with nodes
"""

# Commit changes to the configuration repository 
AdminConfig.save()

# Obtain deployment manager MBean
dm=AdminControl.queryNames("type=DeploymentManager,*")

# "syncActiveNodes" can only be run on the deployment manager's MBean, 
# it will fail in standalone environment
if dm:
    print "Synchronizing configuration repository with nodes. Please wait..."
    # Force sync with all currently active nodes
    nodes=AdminControl.invoke(dm, "syncActiveNodes", "true")
    print "The following nodes have been synchronized: "+str(nodes)
else:
    print "Standalone server, no nodes to sync"
