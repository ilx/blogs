SSO
===

Introduction
------------

Provide evaluation of SSO solutions for .NET and Java applications.
Must support AIX, IHS, identity propagation across application
servers.  Must support IIS, ASP.NET MVC, SPNEGO.  Must have UI for
management of identities, applications, roles, policies.


- SSO - Single sign-on (SSO) is a way to authenticate users on
  multiple related, but independent software systems. Once logged in,
  a user can switch from one system to the next without the need to
  login again. Conversely, single sign-off is a way to log out and
  terminate access to multiple software systems with a single sign-off
  action. 
  
  In contrast, a shared authentication scheme that requires the user
  to log in multiple times using the same identity is not called SSO.
  An example is a central user directory such as Active Directory,
  where users login to their Windows desktop, then enter login name
  and password again to login into an application using the same
  credentials

  Sign-on, a Convenient Way to Authenticate Users])

- Benefits - There are many benefits in favor of SSO:
 - Usability: Users only need to remember one login and password. 
 - Security:  Centralized reporting for compliance adherence. SSO reduces the risk of phishing because users do not need to login multiple times.
 - Productivity: Reduced time spent re-entering passwords. Reduced IT costs due to lower number of IT help desk calls related to passwords.
 - _Overall productivity_: SSO allows us to develop modular
   portal-like applications. This allows us to decouple software
   functionality, faster turnarounds, bug fixes...

- Disadvantages: There are also disadvantages. 
 - An obvious one is single point of failure: All systems go down if the SSO authentication server fails.
 - Another one is security: All systems will be accessible by an intruder if a user account is compromised.



- Reverse proxy ?
- Proxy authentication support ?
- Federated Single Sign-on - systems are designed to work when the
Identity Provider and Service Provider are NOT always in the same
organization. Service Provider may wish to work with more than one
Identity Provider, and likewise a given Identity Provider might wish
to work with multiple Service Providers. When a group of Identity and
Service Providers agree to work together, this group is called a
federation. (from http://shibboleth.net/about/basic.html[How
Shibboleth Works: Basic Concepts])

JEE considerations
-------------------

Applications should configure web.xml:
- login-config element
- security-constraint element
- security-role element

How about spring security?
